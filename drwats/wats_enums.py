    I recommend naming all enums UPPER_CASE. They're constants (within a namespace) and that's the rule for constants.

    You can only subclass a custom enumeration if it doesnâ€™t have members.

    This class extends the functionality of the Enum class by adding two class methods, list and tuple, that allow
    for easy conversion of the Enum elements into either a list or a tuple.

    By adding the str class (known as mixin classes) this also means
    that class.member == class.member.value are the same.
    This makes it easier to use the enum member as the value and more like a class attribute.
    StrEnum is included in Python3.11
